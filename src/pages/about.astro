            I'm a Licensed Mental Health Counselor (LMHC) offering online psychotherapy to adults living in Washington
            DC and Virginia. I specialize in somatic-focused therapy, which means I help you connect with your body to
            heal from past trauma, anxiety, and depression.
          </p>
          <p>When I'm not working, you can find me hanging out with my wife, son, and two cats.</p>
