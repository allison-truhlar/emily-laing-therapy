            I have advanced training in Somatic Experiencing (Levels 1 and 2) and enjoy working with clients who are
            interested in exploring the mind-body connection.

          <p>
            Prior to providing individual therapy, I worked in community mental health supporting families. I received
            training in the Postive Parenting Program (Triple P), an evidence-based program empowering parents to
            promote positive behavioral change in their children. As such, I'm also excited to work with parents who are
            looking for support.
          </p>

            As a member of the LGBTQ+ community, I am passionate about supporting clients who are navigating their
            sexuality.
